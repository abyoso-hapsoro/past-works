# Competition
I have joined many competitions during the duration of TBA, this directory contains those I have managed to salvage.
- Many are lost to disorganization hell (especially in team format)
- Some are done on the spot without possibility of local documentation
- Some are simply non-coding competitions*
- etc.

## Note
(*) I may create a separate directory for non-coding competitions in the future
