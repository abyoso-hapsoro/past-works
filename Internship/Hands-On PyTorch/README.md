Tasked to learn PyTorch for internship work. This was done based on the [official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

## Image Classification on CIFAR-10
[CIFAR-10](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-10) is a very popular dataset consisting of 6000 images per class with 5000 training and 1000 testing images for 10 classes. This was only explored with basic Convolutional Neural Networks and only trained with 3 epochs theferore no strong insight was resulted. However, this was not the goal of the section.

- Basic CNN achieved 56% accuracy. This suggests the network learns as chance is 10% accuracy (randomly picking 1 of 10 classes)
- GPU training being significantly faster than CPU is empirically proven

## Image Classification on Hymenoptera
Hymenoptera is a very small subset of [ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet) with 120 training and 75 validation images for ants and bees. PyTorch supports this dataset and can be downloaded [here](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip).

In cases like these, we can use Transfer Learning to generalize reasonably well. Achieved 86.48% training accuracy and 94.12% validation accuracy using ResNet-18.

## Data Loading and Processing on Face Pose Estimation
This dataset was generated by applying excellent [dlib's pose estimation](https://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html) on a few images from [ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/imagenet) tagged as face. PyTorch supports this dataset and can be downloaded [here](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/faces.zip).

## Background
- Purpose: AI Engineer Intern at [Konvergen AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/konvergen-ai/)** Onboarding Tool Familiarity Task (Week 1)
- Involvement: Individual
- Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch

## Notes
- Planned for Improvement: No
    - Each of the cases above may potentially be excavated to [Computer Vision](../../Machine%20Learning/Computer%20Vision) explored more thoroughly in the far future
- Python Version: 3.6
- (*) The script was only lightly edited thus last updated is kept as it was
    - `%%capture` to reduce output junk
    - `iter().next()` to `next(iter())` to accomodate newer torch version
- (**) Now [merged into Datasaur](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/datasaur_datasaureatstheworld-nlp-ocr-activity-6904289215186644992-_R4u/)
