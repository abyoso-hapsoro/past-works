# Word List
Final Project for Algorithm and Programming (SCMA601400) course. I was the lead programmer for this project.
<br><br><br>
Word List is a program to list words and their occurences in a text.
<br><br>
How to use the application (`Daftar Kata.exe`):
1. Application will set the directory to the folder which contains this application
2. Prepare a .txt file such as Teks.txt in the folder <br>

3. Results will be stored in Hasil.txt, the following is a snippet of the result <br>

4. You can redo this for other files by answering y or exit with n. However the result will always be stored in Hasil.txt, so if we want to store results for multiple files then we need to handle manually in the folder
