This project was an attempt to solve the open problem:

<center>

Determine the exact value of $es(P_n\Box P_m\Box P_l)$ for $m,n\geq2$ and $l\geq3$
</center>

posed in July 2018 at AKCE International Journal of Graphs and Combinatorics, available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S097286001730107X). Checking back in July 2023, this problem doesn't seem to have been solved yet*.
