An all-feature simple linear regression model performs at an adjusted R-squared of 0.8962. At the end of the analysis, the best model given by $`\hat{y} = 6.1645 + 0.0509x_1 + 0.0352x_2 + 0.0009x_1x_2 âˆ’ 0.0001x^2_1`$ improves the performance to an adjusted R-squared of 0.9857*.

(*) where $`y`$ is sales, $`x_1`$ is YouTube, $`x_2`$ is Facebook, $`x_3`$ is newspaper, and all $`x_i`$ are advertising budgets. $`x_3`$ is determined to be deteriorating to learning thus dropped. All numbers are rounded to 4 decimal points.
